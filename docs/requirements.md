## 1. Project Goals & Scope

### Goals
- **Goal 1**: Deliver a working MVP that enables users to plan tasks on a timeline quickly and efficiently
- **Goal 2**: Provide a clean, responsive UI that scales between desktop and mobile devices
- **Goal 3**: Maintain a simple data model so users can export projects without complex migrations
- **Goal 4**: Enable personal and small-team project planning without mandatory cloud collaboration

### Scope
- **In Scope**: Core task management, Gantt timeline visualization, local data persistence, responsive UI
- **Out of Scope**: Real-time multi-user collaboration, external project file import, notifications/alerts, enterprise integrations

### Major Constraints
- Browser-first application using localStorage for persistence
- Lightweight solution targeting personal/small-team use
- No server-side requirements for MVP

### Success Criteria
- A user can create a 3-task project, adjust dates via the UI, reload the page, and see changes preserved
- UI renders correctly at common desktop and mobile breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px+)
- Basic keyboard navigation exists for task selection and editing
- Core functionality works offline after initial load

## 2. Functional Requirements

### Task Management
- **REQ-001**: The system SHALL allow users to create new tasks with title, start date, and end date so that project activities can be tracked.
  - **User Story**: As a project planner, I want to create tasks so that I can organize my project work.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
    - Given I am on the main application page
    - When I click "Add Task" button
    - Then a new task is created with default title "New Task" and today's date as start/end
    - And the task appears in both the task list and Gantt timeline

- **REQ-002**: The system SHALL allow users to edit task properties (title, start date, end date, percent complete) so that project information can be updated.
  - **User Story**: As a project planner, I want to edit task details so that I can keep project information current.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Given I have an existing task
    - When I modify any task property in the sidebar
    - Then the changes are immediately reflected in both the task list and Gantt timeline
    - And the changes persist when the page is reloaded

- **REQ-003**: The system SHALL allow users to delete tasks so that outdated or unnecessary tasks can be removed.
  - **User Story**: As a project planner, I want to delete tasks so that I can remove items that are no longer needed.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Given I have an existing task
    - When I click the "Delete" button for that task
    - Then the task is removed from both the task list and Gantt timeline
    - And the deletion persists when the page is reloaded

### Timeline Visualization
- **REQ-004**: The system SHALL render tasks on a visual Gantt timeline with time axis so that project schedules can be visualized.
  - **User Story**: As a project planner, I want to see tasks on a timeline so that I can understand project scheduling.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Given I have tasks with start and end dates
    - When I view the Gantt area
    - Then tasks are displayed as bars positioned according to their dates
    - And the timeline shows appropriate time scale (days/weeks/months)

### Data Persistence
- **REQ-005**: The system SHALL save project data to browser localStorage so that work is preserved between sessions.
  - **User Story**: As a project planner, I want my work saved automatically so that I don't lose progress.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Given I have made changes to tasks
    - When I reload the browser page
    - Then all my task data is restored exactly as I left it
    - And no data is lost during normal browser operations

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-001**: The system SHALL load initial interface within 2 seconds on standard broadband connections.
- **NFR-002**: The system SHALL handle up to 50 tasks without noticeable performance degradation (smooth scrolling and interactions).

### Usability
- **NFR-003**: The system SHALL be operable via keyboard navigation for primary functions (create, edit, delete tasks).
- **NFR-004**: The system SHALL provide responsive design that works on screen sizes from 320px to 1920px width.

### Accessibility
- **NFR-005**: The system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for screen reader compatibility on core functionality.
- **NFR-006**: The system SHALL provide sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 ratio minimum) for all text elements.

### Reliability
- **NFR-007**: The system SHALL gracefully handle localStorage quota exceeded errors by notifying the user.
- **NFR-008**: The system SHALL preserve data integrity during browser crashes (no partial saves that corrupt data).

### Maintainability
- **NFR-009**: The system SHALL use modern React patterns and maintain component modularity for easy feature additions.
- **NFR-010**: The system SHALL include clear documentation for development setup and architecture decisions.

## 4. Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: React 18+ with Vite build system
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with localStorage support (Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+)
- **Data Storage**: Browser localStorage only (no server database)
- **Deployment**: Static file hosting (no server-side processing required)

### Integrations
- **External Dependencies**: Minimal third-party libraries to reduce bundle size
- **APIs**: No external API dependencies for MVP

### Policies & Standards
- **Data Privacy**: All data stored locally in user's browser (no data transmission to servers)
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines where technically feasible

### Timeline Constraints
- **MVP Deadline**: Target completion within 4-6 weeks
- **Release Cycle**: Iterative releases with user feedback incorporation

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Server-side data synchronization
- Mobile native applications
- Integration with external project management tools
- Advanced scheduling algorithms (critical path, resource optimization)
- Billing or payment processing

## 6. Labeling Scheme

### GitHub Issue Labels for Requirements Management

#### Level Labels (Blue Theme)
- `level:goal` - High-level business goals and objectives
- `level:epic` - Large features spanning multiple stories
- `level:story` - Individual user stories and requirements

#### Requirement Type Labels (Gray Theme)
- `req:type:functional` - Functional requirements (what the system does)
- `req:type:non-functional` - Non-functional requirements (how well the system performs)

#### Non-Functional Requirement Categories (Green Theme)
- `nfr:performance` - Performance and scalability requirements
- `nfr:security` - Security and privacy requirements
- `nfr:accessibility` - Accessibility and usability requirements
- `nfr:reliability` - Reliability and error handling requirements

#### Priority Labels (Red/Orange/Yellow Theme)
- `priority:P1` - Critical/Must Have
- `priority:P2` - Important/Should Have
- `priority:P3` - Nice to Have/Could Have

#### Status Labels (Purple Theme)
- `status:ready` - Ready for implementation
- `status:in-progress` - Currently being worked on
- `status:testing` - Implementation complete, testing needed
- `status:blocked` - Blocked by dependency or issue
- `status:complete` - Fully implemented and verified

#### Domain Labels (Custom Colors)
- `domain:ui` - User interface related

### Label Usage Guidelines
1. **Required Labels**: Every requirement issue should have one label from each relevant category
2. **Label Lifecycle**: Add labels at issue creation, update during grooming and implementation
3. **Cleanup**: Remove transient labels (like `status:in-progress`) after completion
4. **Consistency**: Use consistent labeling across all team members

3. **Link Requirements**: Reference requirement ID in issue title or description
4. **Assign Milestone**: Link to appropriate project milestone

### Pull Request Process
1. **Reference Requirements**: Include requirement ID in PR title or description
2. **Link Issues**: Use "Closes #issue-number" to auto-link
3. **Update Traceability**: Update the traceability table when PR is merged
4. **Test References**: Ensure tests reference the requirement ID they validate

### Requirement Updates
1. **Version Control**: Track requirement changes through Git commits
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess impact of requirement changes on existing implementation
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Get approval for significant requirement modifications
4. **Documentation**: Update both requirements.md and any affected design documents
